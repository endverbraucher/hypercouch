# Hypercouch

HyperCouch is my attempt to an svbtle inspired blogging web app with Ruby and Rails and CouchDB.

## Setup
You should set an environment variable `Couch` for couchdb.yml that points to your CouchDB instance. For OSX look here: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa1067/_index.html
